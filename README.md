# CommandoJS #


Background
----------
CommandoJS is a study on HTML5 canvas and audio capabilities implemented using CoffeeScript.
It is also a nostalgic glimpse in the past in a form of Commodore 64 game "Commando".

Used libraries
--------------
The game uses MelonJS library for low level functionality (e.g. input handling, sprite drawing
and camera handling).

Unit tests are implemented with QUnit.

Inspiration
-----------
Inspiration to create this game was gotten from couple of similar projects:

* Blitz Basic Commando Remake: http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=90079
* HTML5 Command and Conquer: http://www.adityaravishankar.com/projects/games/command-and-conquer/
* Infinite Mario Bros. in HTML5: http://www.rawrbitrary.com/arcade/infinite-mario-bros-in-html5/

Notes
-----
* Game has only rough implementation for level 1 of the game
* At the stage of the initial exposure, code is not optimized neither for performance nor beauty
* Unit tests are far from complete
